External save button with CJMCU-Beetle (Ardiono Leonardo)

## Features

- When the external button is hit, the device sends Control-S (Command-S in Mac mode) keystroke
- USB hotplug (MacOS will pop up the new-keyboard-found window)
- DIP switch for selecting Linux/Windows or Mac mode
- DIP switch for prank mode (sometimes pressing shift key)

## Status

- Platformio environment is set up, test code sends out a meaningful 'x' character in every 3 s
- We have the CJMCU-Beetle hardware
- We've ordered a great sustain pedal. Or tatoo pedal, I don't remember.
- Need to figure out boxing and hardware switches
