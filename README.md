# savebutton
External save button with CJMCU-Beetle (Ardiono Leonardo) or Digispark ATTiny85

## Features

- When the external button is hit, the device sends Control-S (Command-S in Mac mode) keystroke
- USB hotplug (MacOS will pop up the new-keyboard-found window, just push it away)
- DIP switch for selecting Linux-Windows or Mac mode
- DIP switch for prank mode (sometimes pressing shift key)

## Status

- We have a working prototype with CJMCU-Beetle hardware
- Anyone can make it, documentation available (Fritzing drawing)
- We have a logo proposal
- Platformio multi-platform compiler set up
- We've ordered a great sustain pedal, or tatoo pedal, I don't remember
- Need to figure out boxing and hardware switches
