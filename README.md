# savebutton
Save now. Save Often.

## What is it
External save button with CJMCU-Beetle (Ardiono Leonardo) or Digispark ATTiny85, connects with USB.

## Features

- When the external button is hit, the device sends Control-S (Command-S in Mac mode) keystroke
- USB hotplug (MacOS will pop up the new-keyboard-found window, just push it away)
- DIP switch for selecting Linux/Windows or Mac mode

## Status

- We have a working prototype with CJMCU-Beetle hardware
- Anyone can make it, documentation available (Fritzing drawing)
- We have a logo proposal
- Platformio multi-platform compiler set up
- We've ordered a great sustain pedal, or tatoo pedal, I don't remember
- Need to figure out boxing and hardware switches

## Plans

- Better indicator blinking
- Documentation for Digispark version
- Better logo
- Save reminder

## Future

- Bluetooth version
